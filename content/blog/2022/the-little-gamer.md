### This Is My Little Daughter - `Rossy`

Rossy is one bright, little first-grader, who loves to play with the local kids, which I like to call `the little thugs`.

### Back To School

Well, `Back to school` might not be the best phrase here, because she has never been to school in the first place. However it's a popular catch-phrase recently, and since this is my `personal blog` I'mma write whatever I want, even it might won't make no sense occasionally. 

So, as I mentioned `Rossy` is a first-grader and, like every little curious adventurer, she got her first brand new... `daddy's old lap-top`. She likes watching youtube videos, and she even has favorite creators/youtubers called [Danny And Andy](https://www.youtube.com/c/AndyStudio).

She really enjoys school and never skips homework. During the weekend `the little thugs` participate in on-line activities such as playing all kinds of video games. Rossy's favorite game is called `Minecraft`.

### Shaping The Young Mind In The Right Direction

As a responsible father I'm taking all steps to develop her as a responsible, tech-loving, curious adventurer. Here is my recipe, that I'm following to achieve my goal - ordered by importance: 

1. Use [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html)
2. Never Skip Homeworks
3. Don't Forget to `Backup` and `Encrypt` All Important Data
4. Prefer To Use The Terminal Over GUI
5. Always Use `Free` and/or `Open-Source Software`
6. If, in any case, you need to use licensed and paid software - never use pirated one! Respect the hard work of the developers!
