### This is my wife - `Lilly`

It's been an incredible year for my wife, Lilly. Just over a year ago, she made the brave decision to quit her job and pursue her dream of becoming a software engineer. It was a huge leap of faith for her, as she had no prior experience in programming or IT. 

But Lilly was determined to make it work, and so she threw herself into learning the ins and outs of software engineering. She spent her days studying, taking online courses and reading up on the latest trends in the industry. She spent her nights coding, debugging and troubleshooting problems. 

It was hard work and a long journey, but two months ago, Lilly landed her first job as a Java developer. It was an incredible moment for both of us, and we celebrated her success with a nice dinner out. 

Now, Lilly is completely immersed in the world of software engineering and is loving every minute of it. She's constantly challenging herself to learn new skills and technologies, and she's already building a strong portfolio of projects. 

I'm so proud of Lilly for following her dreams and making them a reality. She's an inspiration to me and to anyone who's considering taking the leap into a new career. It's never too late to pursue your dreams, and Lilly is living proof of that.
